# oauth

This code base are examples and exercises completed from OAuth 2.0 in Action. The code base uses Expression.js, Node.js, and Underscore.js. 

The current code basis covers the OpenID connect (an authentication scheme build on top of OAuth), client logic and token refreshing logic.

There are some great intoductory notes under https://github.com/syeed-ode/notes/blob/master/oauth/oauth2InAction_*.
